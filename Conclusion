Roc_auc_score: Fasttext=0.841 > LSTM=0.7960 > SVM(linear)

Time cost:     Fasttext < SVM(linear)  < LSTM

Comparing with other 2 models, Fasttext is the best one.



SVM: does not perform well because it cannot use context information, but simply vectorizes the text and then classifies it.

LSTM: can use context information, but  it has a high time and ROM cost.

Both SVM and LSTM cannot preprocess data.


Fasttext: 1.fastText does not require pre-trained word vectors, fastText will train word vectors by itself.
          2.Two important optimizations of fastText (Hierarchical Softmax, N-gram) perform better
